	/**	This AudioObject applies a resonant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low-pass filter</a> to a Sample or SampleBundle.
	
		This object was originally the tap.fourpole~ external in TapTools for Max and used extensively in the Hipno plug-ins.
	
		A fourth-order algorithm based on the Moog VCF is used to acheive a relatively flat passband.
        Subtle modifications from <a href="http://www.musicdsp.org/archive.php?classid=3#26">the original source</a> to improve control of the frequency cutoff.
	
		The conclusion of the Stilson/Smith paper ( https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/moogvcf.pdf ) concludes: 
		"Implementability issues make the conversion of the Moog VCF to a digital form nontrivial." 
		Basically digital versions of this filter are either going to get good frequency control or resonance, but not both.
	
		Also see related research at http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/AMT_MSc_FinalProjects/2012__Daly__AMT_MSc_FinalProject_MoogVCF.pdf
		Specifically: "it is possible to create a very accurate model of the Moog VCF but at considerable costs to either cut-off frequency range or input signal amplitude and computational expense. 
						Any further investigations should not seek to improve the accuracy of the model but focus on the problems of stability and computational time."

		@warning The cutoff frequency is only stable below about one-fourth the sampling rate.
        In addition, it will tend to sound flat below 1000 Hz and go sharp above 1000 Hz.
